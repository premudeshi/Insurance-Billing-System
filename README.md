This software was tested on <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a>, a powerful tool that is designed to allow a PHP server to be run on your local host. Although WAMP can also be used, it hasn't been tested and thus we suggest you to use <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a>.
