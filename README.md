# Insurance Billing System

A powerful client that is used for making invoices and prformas for an Insurance surveyors. This tool is still under devolopment and only 2 features are fully functional. There are plans to build more but in the comming weeks. The main contributer to this project is currently in school, thus the devolopment of this project is going slow. 


<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Login Feature</li>
	<p>Allow your staff to have custom logins or to have a single login. This feature is under design.</p>
	<li>Invoving and Performas</li>
	<p>Incase you don't know what the diffrance between performa and Invoice is, I shall explain. A Performa is like an Draft Bill. The Results can be changed. But the billing on an Invoice can not be changed and it is the final and approved bill.</p>
	<li>Comes with free Installation file</li>
	<p>This comes with a Automatic installer file which is currently under devolopment. This feature will allow you to install these files hassle free. But so far, you may only use the manual installer. </p>

</ul>



<h2>Installation</h2>

This software was tested on <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a>, a powerful tool that is designed to allow a PHP server to be run on your local host. Although WAMP can also be used, it hasn't been tested and thus we suggest you to use <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a>. 

<ol type="1">
  <li>First, download these files in a zip and unextract them</li>
  <li>Then, Generate open your phpMyAdmin and navigate to the SQL input</li>
  <li>Copy and Paste the Code from the "Sqlcode.SQL" File in this folder into the SQL console of SQL</li>
    <li>Hit Go and wait for the results. You should have 1 database and 1 table</li>
</ol>


One those have been completed, you should have installed this client.
